I will use the Technologies in the following ways.

HTML – I will use four HTML pages. One for login, one for the game itself, one to see the game history of the player, and one for a leaderboard. I might make another one too like in the Simon to have a quote and a picture or something. The html structure will be correct.

CSS- I will make it look pretty so it doesn’t just look like plain connect 4. I will use a styling such that it won’t be hard to play on a phone. I want the rows of the connect four game to be big enough such that nobody fails to click on the correct place. Hopefully, I’ll be able to make it look better than a simple 2d model and I’ll be able to put an animation for the tokens dropping.

JavaScript – It will help with login and everything that has to do with the game including the coin dropping and determining when someone wins. I think I’ll also have to use JavaScript to make the code for the computer opponent. 

Service – I can use the backend service for login, and the leaderboard of who has the best win ratio or the most wins.
DB – Store the users, the games, and the win and loss percentage.
Login- Register and login users. One can log in so that they can access their own wins and losses and play as themselves. 

WebSocket- When someone’s win ratio changes, it will broadcast it to all the other users in the leaderboard.
React- Application ported to use the React web framework.

Startup HTML
I deployed the simon files to my website and I changed a couple things. I added a new page called "yee", and I added a link to it in all of the other pages. The page, "yee" has a bit of text and a lot of buttons in it.
